"""corpus.d/50-chapters.json: further chapters of the Laws of Guyana, each from the revised editions online.

Reads only the cache. Deterministic. Written atomically. Uses the
layout and segmentation of parse.py (the same as the Civil Law and Criminal Law (Offences) Acts in corpus.json).

Today's official text on mola.gov.gy is L.R.O. 1/2022 for Cap. 3:02 only; for Caps. 10:01 and 98:01 (and 89:01, in its
own part, companies.py) the Ministry still serves the L.R.O. 1/2012 PDF (byte-identical to the Internet Archive capture of 2022), so those have
one version.
